There are 3 Assignments in this repository. 

First Assignment (numbers puzzle): A player is given a certain number of digits at the start. We then determine if the series of number provided can be played with the digits that we were give at the start. If the digits can be played, we calculate the scores associated with each value (from 0 to 9). If the digits have consecutive numbers, the sum of the value of the score will be multiplied by the number of consecutive values. At the end, we have to find out which number obtains the highest value, and that is the answer we are looking for. 

Second assignement (binary tree): We are given a binary tree of fruits from the root node to the lead node. We then expect the output to display the nodes from the leaf nodes all the way until the root nodes. Finally, we have to calculate the node count and the leaf node count. 

The third assignment (data mining and machine learning):  We are given a complex tree of many nodes that represents the weather under different conditions like rain, temperature and wind. By using vectors to write down the values in the tree, we determine if the weather condition is deemed acceptable, good or poor for that current situation. 

My code for all three assignments are provided in the folder.
