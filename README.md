There are 3 Assignments in this repository. 

The first assignment At each round the player is given some digits.
The player submits a sequence of digits using some or all of the given digits for the round.
The submitted sequence must be one of the allowed ones as specified in a given list. The list may change from game instance to game instance but stays the same across different rounds of the same game instance.
The sequence submitted by the player at each round gets a score that is computed as follows (if you have doubts about the interpretation of the following please refer to the examples provided further down, including those provided specifically for function score):
For each digit, the corresponding value is added (however values may be positive or negative). A list is given with the value for each digit. This list may change from game instance to game instance but stays the same across different rounds of the same game instance.
The value of (sub)sequences of digits in consecutive ascending order are multiplied times the length of the sequence.
The player clearly wants to submit the sequence with the highest possible score for that round.
